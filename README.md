# Tito's Food Bowl
Tito's Food Bowl is a fictional restaurant owned by my pug, Tito. This is my first Web Development project, created with **HTML**.
## Features
  - basic HTML formatting
  - basic styling for the background color and centering the text for the website
  - embedded images of the "menu" items, in this case, my dog.

### Improvements
  - improve the styling and make it more aesthetically pleasing, with no gaps between the sections.
  - the form does not take the potential customer to a checkout page
